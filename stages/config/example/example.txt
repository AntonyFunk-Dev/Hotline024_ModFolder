scale:
Sets the character's size. 1 means default size, while values above or below adjust the scale up or down.
(All offset animations are automatically adjusted)

scrollFactor:
Controls how fast characters move in the background compared to the camera.
    1 = Moves at the camera's pace (foreground).
    Lower values (like 0.5) make characters move more slowly, creating depth by simulating background distance.



Camera Settings:
Holds camera-specific settings for each character:
    target_offset: Adjusts the camera's tracking offset, with higher values panning it away from center.

    zoom: Controls the camera zoom level, smaller values zoom out, larger values zoom in on the character.

    pos_locked: Locks the camera to specific coordinates. Set an empty array [] for a dynamic camera or use [x, y] values to fix its position.


Reflect Settings:
Defines the reflection parameters for each character:

    alpha: Controls the transparency of the reflection.

    offsetY: Adjusts the vertical position of the reflection.

    blend: Sets the blend mode for the reflection effect. Use different Haxe blend modes such as "add", "multiply", "screen", or others listed specifically here: https://api.openfl.org/openfl/display/BlendMode.html

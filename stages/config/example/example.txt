order:
Determines the rendering order of characters:
    0 = First to render (opponent)
    1 = Second to render (boyfriend)
    2 = Third to render (girlfriend)
    Setting a higher order value brings characters to the front.
(Remember that 2 or more characters cannot have the same order)

scale:
Sets the character's size. 1 means default size, while values above or below adjust the scale up or down.
(All offset animations are automatically adjusted)

scrollFactor:
Controls how fast characters move in the background compared to the camera.
    1 = Moves at the camera's pace (foreground).
    Lower values (like 0.5) make characters move more slowly, creating depth by simulating background distance.



Camera Settings:
Holds camera-specific settings for each character:
    target_offset: Adjusts the camera's tracking offset, with higher values panning it away from center.

    zoom: Controls the camera zoom level, smaller values zoom out, larger values zoom in on the character.

    pos_locked: Locks the camera to specific coordinates. Set an empty array [] for a dynamic camera or use [x, y] values to fix its position.

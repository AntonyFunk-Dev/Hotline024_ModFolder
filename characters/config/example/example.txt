Type:
Defines the movement style:
    0 = Pingpong: Creates a continuous up-and-down motion. This movement can feel smooth or bouncy depending on the ease.
    1 = Beat Movement: Moves with each beat of the music. The feel of this motion also depends on the ease setting.

Speed:
Controls how fast the movement is. Lower values make it snappier, higher values slow it down.

Ease:
Sets the motionâ€™s smoothness style, like linear or ease In/Out. This affects how naturally the character moves and stops.

Amount:
Determines how much the character moves vertically. It can be a single value for consistent movement or a range (like [min, max, decimal]) to add variation. Leave it empty for no extra vertical movement.

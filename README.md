## About the port

Hey, it's me, a fun coder, and yeah, I brought **Hotline 024** to the **Psych Engine** (big shoutout to Saruky and the team for the original mod, obviously). So now that you're here, let me spill the tea â€”getting this port up and running? Not exactly a walk in the park but yeah... was it worth it? (Yes.)

I hope you enjoy it, 'cause who knows... I might keep doing more of these fucking things, lmao.

## About the port

Hey, it's me, a fun coder, and yeah, I brought **Hotline 024** to the **Psych Engine** (big shoutout to Saruky and the team for the original mod, obviously).

So now that you're here, let me spill the tea â€” getting this port up and running? Not exactly a walk in the park, especially since I was low-key losing my motivation working on this alone (but hey, who cares about my mental health, huh?).

And... was it worth it? (Maybe... just a little.)

I hope you enjoy it, 'cause who knows... I might keep doing more of these fucking things, lmao.
